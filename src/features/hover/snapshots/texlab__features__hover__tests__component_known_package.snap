    "value": "The package provides the principal packages in the AMS-LaTeX distribution. It adapts for use in LaTeX most of the mathematical features found in AMS-TeX; it is highly recommended as an adjunct to serious mathematical typesetting in LaTeX. When amsmath is loaded, AMS-LaTeX packages amsbsy (for bold symbols), amsopn (for operator names) and amstext (for text embedded in mathematics) are also loaded. amsmath is part of the LaTeX required distribution; however, several contributed packages add still further to its appeal; examples are empheq, which provides functions for decorating and highlighting mathematics, and ntheorem, for specifying theorem (and similar) definitions."
