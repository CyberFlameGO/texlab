When amsmath is loaded, AMS-LaTeX packages amsbsy (for bold symbols), amsopn (for operator names) and amstext (for text embedded in mathematics) are also loaded. amsmath is part of the LaTeX required distribution; however, several contributed packages add still further to its appeal; examples are empheq, which provides functions for decorating and highlighting mathematics, and ntheorem, for specifying theorem (and similar) definitions."

Hundreds of LaTeX packages are supported, and their load order is automatically verified. Documents may be produced by LaTeX, LuaLaTeX, XeLaTeX, and by several CJK engines, classes, and packages. A texlua script automates compilation, index, glossary, and batch image processing, and also supports latexmk. Configuration is semi-automatic at the first manual compile. Support files are self-generated. Print and HTML versions of each document may coexist. Assistance is provided for HTML import into EPUB conversion software and word processors. Requirements include the commonly-available Poppler utilities, and Perl. Detailed installation instructions are included for each of the major operating systems and TeX distributions. A quick-start tutorial is provided."
